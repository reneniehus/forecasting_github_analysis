# live here rather than being sprinkled through the analysis code.

  # The survey export comes in two flavours, and the same code runs on either:
  #   survey_deidentified.xlsx  full export incl. the open text -- PRIVATE, never published,
  #                             because four open answers name their own country/institute.
  #   survey_public_notext.xlsx identical closed answers with every free-text cell blanked
  #                             (built by code/02_survey/make_public_survey.R) -- the copy
  #                             published in the public repository.
  # Prefer the full export when it is present, otherwise fall back to the public copy.

  # The two forecasting-hub clones live OUTSIDE the repo (they are ~1.7 GB of

  #   ensemble : the hub's OFFICIAL combined product (team_model_designation == "ensemble").
  #              NB fjordhest-ensemble is a *participating team's* model (designation "primary"),
  #              not a hub ensemble, so it is deliberately NOT listed here -- it counts as a model.
  #   baseline : the reference baseline each hub ships to benchmark against.
